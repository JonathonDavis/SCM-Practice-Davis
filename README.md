# Source Control Management (SCM) Practice

## What is Source Control Management?

Source Control Management (SCM) is a system that helps developers track and manage changes to their code over time, allowing you to:
- Track all changes made to your code
- Work on different features simultaneously
- Revert to previous versions if needed
- Collaborate with other developers efficiently
- Maintain a history of your project's evolution

## How GitHub Helps with SCM

GitHub is a popular platform that enhances SCM by providing:
- **Centralized Repository**: A cloud-based storage for your code
- **Branching and Merging**: Easy creation of separate development branches
- **Pull Requests**: A way to review and merge code changes
- **Issue Tracking**: Built-in tools for managing bugs and feature requests
- **Collaboration Features**: Tools for team communication and code review
- **Version Control**: Complete history of all changes and who made them


## Best Practices
- Write clear commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Regularly pull changes from the main branch
- Review code before merging
- Use branches for new features or bug fixes
